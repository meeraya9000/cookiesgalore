            <h3 style="border: 3px solid black"> How it all started</h3>

With every batch she baked, the aroma of freshly made cookies filled the air, captivating the hearts and taste buds of all who sampled her creations. One sunny afternoon, while sipping her favorite cup of tea, the talented baker had a brilliant idea. She decided to start her very own cookie company and share her passion for baking with the world. She named her newfound venture Cookies Galore. With unwavering dedication and countless hours of experimenting in her cozy kitchen, she perfected an exquisite selection of cookies that were second to none. Word of her delectable treats spread like wildfire, attracting customers from near and far. Cookies Galore quickly became a beloved destination for cookie enthusiasts, and the demand for her heavenly treats grew rapidly. The little bakery flourished, and soon, she was delivering her cookies to neighboring towns and cities. With each passing year, Cookies Galore expanded its reach, gaining a devoted following of cookie enthusiasts who eagerly anticipated each new creation. The bakery became a symbol of warmth and joy, spreading happiness through the delightful flavors of its cookies. Today, Cookies Galore continues to thrive, guided by the passion and love of its creator. It remains a cherished place for cookie lovers to experience the joy and delight that only freshly baked cookies can bring. And so, the legacy of Cookies Galore lives on, one batch of delicious cookies at a time. </p>
